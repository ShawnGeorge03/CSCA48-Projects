# CSCA48-A1-Movie-Review-Database

In this Project I built a Simple Movie Review Database that has certain basic functionality which helps one to figure out if a certain movie is good or not.


## Usage

Some of the basic functionality provided are the following:

1) Insert a new movie review : This allows a user to enter a review for a movie
    <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
      <li>Box Office Total for the Movie</li>
      <li>Score the user places on the Movie</li>
    </ul>

2) Search for a movie review : This allows a user to look at the review for a movie
    <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
    </ul>
            
 3) Modify an existing movie review : This allows the user to make changes to a movie review
     <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
      <li>Box Office Total for the Movie</li>
      <li>Score the user places on the Movie</li>
     </ul>
    
 4) Delete a movie review : 
     <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
     </ul>
    
 5) Print out existing reviews : 
     <ul>Input : N/A</ul>
     
 6) Query reviews by studio :
     <ul>Input : 
      <li>Name of the Studio </li>
     </ul>
    
 7) Query reviews by score :
    <ul>Input : 
      <li>Minimum score to be used</li>
     </ul>
    
 8) Sort reviews by movie title :
     <ul>Input : N/A </ul>
      
 9) Insert cast member : 
     <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
      <li>Name of the cast member</li>
    </ul>
    
 10) Count names in cast list : 
     <ul>Input : 
      <li>Title of the Movie</li>
      <li>Name of the Studio that produced the Movie</li>
      <li>Year the Movie was released</li>
      <li>Name of the cast member</li>
     </ul>
    
 11) Delete list of reviews and exit : Delets the entire database and exits the program
